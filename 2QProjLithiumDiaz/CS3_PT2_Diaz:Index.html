<h4>On January 10 at 6 p.m. KST, the boy group released their repackaged album “DIMENSION : ANSWER” along with the music video for the title track.</h4>

<h4>“Blessed-Cursed” is a hybrid hip hop track, meshing elements of hip hop and ’70s hard rock. The song is about thinking that one is blessed only to realize that they are actually cursed.</h4>

<h4>On January 3 KST, 'Girls Planet 999' project group Kep1er made their long-awaited debut with their first mini-album 'First Impact' featuring 'WA DA DA' as the album's title track.</h4>

<h4>After the group's debut postponement which was scheduled last December 14, fans can't seem to handle their excitement as Kep1er is now making their highly-anticipated debut and immediately breaking records left and right.</h4>

<h4>After recording a whopping 200,000 pre-order copies, the newly-debuted girl group's album has now broken aespa's 'Savage's record as the best-selling girl group debut album in Hanteo's history for selling over 150,000 copies (in less than 24 hours) in its first day of release.</h4>

<h4>Congratulations, Kep1er!</h4>
